# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code

## Description
AS AN employee with a busy schedule, I WANT to add important events to a daily planner SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

## Installation
No installation is needed, the work planner is accessed through a web URL, and user input is saved via localStoarge

## Usage
-Upon arriving on the homepage (via URL), the 9-hour workday schedule will appear with the current time and date
-User will notice the schedule is color-coded depending on the current time of the day. Past hours will be shown in grey, the current hour will be in red, and future hours will be in green.
-Users can click on the time slot they want to edit and can type events, tasks, etc., as needed
-When ready to save the text in the time slot, the user can navigate to the far right of the designated timeslot and click the "save" button annotated with a floppy-disk icon
-All data is saved into localStorage and will be accessible to the user even upon page refresh

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:
